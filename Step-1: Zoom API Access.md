## Step 1: Set Up Zoom API Access

### Creating a Zoom App
1. **Access the Zoom Developer Portal:** Navigate to [https://developer.zoom.us/](https://developer.zoom.us/) to access the Zoom Developer Portal.
2. **Create a New App:** Click on the "Develop" tab, then select "Build App." Choose the appropriate app type based on your use case. For most automation scenarios, an OAuth app is suitable.
3. **Configure App Information:** Provide basic information about your app, such as app name, description, and contact email.
4. **Enable API and OAuth:** Under the "API and OAuth" section, enable the necessary scopes. For downloading cloud recordings, the essential scope is `recording:read`. You might also need `recording:download` depending on how you plan to download the recordings.
5. **Save the App:** Once the configuration is complete, save the app.

### Obtaining API Credentials
1. **Note Down Credentials:** After creating the app, you will have access to your API credentials. These credentials are crucial for authenticating your application with the Zoom API.
   * **Client ID:** This unique identifier represents your app.
   * **Client Secret:** This is a secret key used for authorization.
   * **Account ID:** This identifies the Zoom account associated with the app.
2. **Secure Storage:** It's essential to store these credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding them directly in your code. Consider using environment variables or secure storage services like AWS Secrets Manager.

**Important:**
* **OAuth Flow:** For most use cases, you'll need to implement an OAuth flow to obtain an access token using the Client ID and Client Secret. This access token will be used to authenticate subsequent API requests.
* **Scope Selection:** Carefully choose the necessary API scopes to avoid granting unnecessary permissions. Excessive permissions can pose security risks.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully created a Zoom app and obtained the essential API credentials for proceeding to the next steps of your automation process.
