## Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Lambda

### Accessing Function Configuration
1. **Navigate to Lambda Function:** In the AWS Management Console, go to the Lambda service and select the function you created.
2. **Open Configuration:** Click on the function name to access its configuration page.

### Setting Environment Variables
1. **Go to Configuration Tab:** On the function configuration page, locate and click on the "Configuration" tab.
2. **Edit Environment Variables:** Under the "Environment variables" section, click on "Edit".
3. **Add Variables:**
   * Click on the "Add variable" button.
   * Enter "ZOOM_CLIENT_ID" as the variable name and paste your Zoom Client ID as the value.
   * Repeat the process to add "ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET" and "ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID" with their respective values.
4. **Save Changes:** Click on "Save" to apply the changes.

**Important:**

* **Security:** Ensure that you are securely storing your Zoom API credentials. Avoid hardcoding them directly in the code.
* **Best Practices:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or other secure storage mechanisms for sensitive information.
* **Environment Variables:** Environment variables are a secure way to store configuration information within the Lambda environment.

By following these steps, you have successfully set up the required environment variables for your Lambda function, allowing it to access the necessary Zoom API credentials.
