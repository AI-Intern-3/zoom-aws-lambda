## Step 1: Create the Lambda Function

### Navigate to AWS Lambda
1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console:** Access your AWS account and navigate to the AWS Management Console.
2. **Open the Lambda Service:** Search for "Lambda" in the search bar and select the Lambda service.

### Create a New Lambda Function
1. **Click Create Function:** On the Lambda console, click on the "Create function" button.
2. **Choose Author from scratch:** Select the "Author from scratch" option.
3. **Configure Function:**
   * **Function name:** Give your function a descriptive name (e.g., "zoom-to-s3-uploader").
   * **Runtime:** Select "Python 3.x" as the runtime (choose the latest available version).
   * **Role:** Choose "Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions". This will create a default role with basic permissions for Lambda functions. However, we'll replace this with the role we created earlier in the next step.
   * **Click Create Function:** Proceed to create the function.

### Attach the IAM Role
1. **Edit Function Configuration:** Once the function is created, click on the function name to access its configuration.
2. **Modify Role:** In the "Role" section, edit the existing role and select the IAM role you created earlier (e.g., "zoom-to-s3-role").
3. **Save Changes:** Save the function configuration.

Now you have created a Lambda function with the appropriate IAM role attached to it. This function will be the core component of your automation process.
