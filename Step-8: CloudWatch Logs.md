## Step 1: Monitor and Log with CloudWatch Logs

### Enabling CloudWatch Logs for Your Lambda Function

**CloudWatch Logs** automatically collects and stores logs generated by your Lambda function. By default, Lambda creates a log group named `/aws/lambda/<function-name>` to store your function's logs. 

**No explicit configuration is generally required** to enable logging for a Lambda function. When you run your function, logs are automatically sent to CloudWatch Logs. 

### Viewing and Analyzing Logs

1. **Navigate to CloudWatch:** In the AWS Management Console, go to the CloudWatch service.
2. **Select Logs:** Under the CloudWatch services, choose "Logs".
3. **Find Your Log Group:** Search for the log group `/aws/lambda/<your-function-name>`.
4. **View Log Streams:** Select the log group to see a list of log streams. Each log stream represents a single invocation of your Lambda function.
5. **Inspect Log Events:** Choose a log stream to view the individual log events. These events contain information about the function's execution, including any messages you've logged in your code.

### Best Practices for Logging

* **Include Relevant Information:** Log key parameters, input data, output results, and error messages to aid in troubleshooting.
* **Use Structured Logging:** Consider using structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing and analysis.
* **Set Log Levels:** Use different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) to control the amount of log data generated.
* **Filter and Search:** Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query and filter logs based on specific criteria.
* **Retention Policy:** Configure log retention policies to manage log storage costs.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively monitor and troubleshoot your Lambda function using CloudWatch Logs.
