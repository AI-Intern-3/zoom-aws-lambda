## Step 1: Prepare Your AWS Environment

### Create an S3 Bucket

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console:** Access your AWS account and navigate to the S3 service.
2. **Create a Bucket:** Click on "Create bucket".
3. **Choose a Bucket Name:** Select a unique name for your bucket. Note that bucket names are globally unique.
4. **Select a Region:** Choose the AWS region where you want to store your videos.
5. **Configure Access Control:** Select appropriate access control settings based on your security requirements. For testing purposes, you might choose "Public read" but ensure to change this to a more restrictive setting for production environments.
6. **Create Bucket:** Click on "Create bucket".

### Create an IAM Role

1. **Navigate to IAM:** In the AWS Management Console, go to the IAM service.
2. **Create Role:** Click on "Create role".
3. **Select Role Type:** Choose "AWS service roles" as the trust relationship type.
4. **Select Service:** Choose "Lambda" as the service that will use this role.
5. **Attach Policies:**
   * Search for "AmazonS3FullAccess" and attach it to the role. This policy grants full access to S3 resources.
   * Search for "AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and attach it to the role. This policy provides basic permissions for Lambda functions.
   * You might need to create custom policies with more granular permissions based on your specific requirements.
6. **Review and Create Role:** Review the role details and click "Create role".

**Note:**

* Using `AmazonS3FullAccess` provides broad permissions. Consider creating custom policies with specific actions and resources to enhance security.
* For production environments, implement more stringent access controls and consider using IAM roles with least privilege principles.

By following these steps, you've created an S3 bucket to store your videos and an IAM role with necessary permissions for your Lambda function to interact with S3.
 
**Would you like to proceed to the next step of creating the Lambda function?**
